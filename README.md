# NetworkAnalysis-with-GPU
This repository is dedicated to my master's degree project. The main goal is to implement, using GPU parallelism, algorithms that compute the "_centrality_" of each node and the "_connectivity_" of the network. For now, I have implemented these algorithms:
- **Degree Centrality** (sequential & parallel version): in this case the "centrality" of a node depends on its degree;
- **Closeness Centrality** (sequential & parallel version): here the "centrality" of a node depends on the distances separating it from other nodes in the network;
- **Betweenness centrality** (sequential): here the "centrality" of a node depends on the number of "_shortest paths_" it partecipates in.
